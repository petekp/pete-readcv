      "description": "Candle was a search engine startup co-founded with a few friends during the depths of the 2020 pandemic. Its purpose was to help identify the trustworthiness of information, a very gnarly and arguably impossible task that we nonetheless pursued doggedly for a year before our runway came to an end.\n\nOur long term vision involved developing a linguistic analysis AI model trained via RLHF that would classify a given text across a set of measures (e.g. affect, intent, POV-taking) that together would be used to synthesize a trustworthiness score.\n\nOur short term strategy involved leaning on existing orgs providing similar credibility/fact-checking analysis (e.g. Poynter Institute) to synthesize a score that would be surfaced for each resource on a search results page.\n\nThe main problem we faced, aside from the possible lack of desire for such a product outside a very particular kind of information consumer, was selling others (note: VCs) on our long term strategy which would require non-trivial human capital (trained linguists) to actualize.\n\nWe were also uncertain about the best vehicle for such a tool: a search engine? a reading companion? a full-fledged reading app ala Instapaper? a browser extension? We explored all of these formats to varying degrees of fidelity and decided to move forward with our search engine and browser extension products.\n\nI learned a ton from this experience, including:\n\n• The utter importance of having a starkly clear, concise value prop and ideally very clear demand signal\n• Constantly interrogate your product strategy and routinely discuss and explore radically different product verticals (depending on the scope of your core mission–ours was intentionally broad, though to a fault)\n• How to create a compelling and easy-to-follow company narrative\n• Creating an eye catching brand identity (shout out to Om Malik who was a fan of our brand and design language)\n• Creating anything related to measuring \"truth\" or \"facts\" is an extremely hard sell, and understandably so\n• Not over-indexing on the narratives of the day–at the time, misinformation and disinformation were the subjects du jour but have since lost media and consumer focus\n\nProjects I worked on included:\n• Product design and strategy\n• Brand identity and messaging\n• Designed and did front-end dev for our search product (using React/NextJS)\n• Pitch deck design and copywriting",

          "description": "Candle was a search engine startup co-founded with a few friends during the depths of the 2020 pandemic. Its purpose was to help identify the trustworthiness of information, a very gnarly and arguably impossible task that we nonetheless pursued doggedly for a year before our runway came to an end.\n\nOur long term vision involved developing a linguistic analysis AI model trained via RLHF that would classify a given text across a set of measures (e.g. affect, intent, POV-taking) that together would be used to synthesize a trustworthiness score.\n\nOur short term strategy involved leaning on existing orgs providing similar credibility/fact-checking analysis (e.g. Poynter Institute) to synthesize a score that would be surfaced for each resource on a search results page.\n\nThe main problem we faced, aside from the possible lack of desire for such a product outside a very particular kind of information consumer, was selling others (note: VCs) on our long term strategy which would require non-trivial human capital (trained linguists) to actualize.\n\nWe were also uncertain about the best vehicle for such a tool: a search engine? a reading companion? a full-fledged reading app ala Instapaper? a browser extension? We explored all of these formats to varying degrees of fidelity and decided to move forward with our search engine and browser extension products.\n\nI learned a ton from this experience, including:\n\n• The utter importance of having a starkly clear, concise value prop and ideally very clear demand signal\n• Constantly interrogate your product strategy and routinely discuss and explore radically different product verticals (depending on the scope of your core mission–ours was intentionally broad, though to a fault)\n• How to create a compelling and easy-to-follow company narrative\n• Creating an eye catching brand identity (shout out to Om Malik who was a fan of our brand and design language)\n• Creating anything related to measuring \"truth\" or \"facts\" is an extremely hard sell, and understandably so\n• Not over-indexing on the narratives of the day–at the time, misinformation and disinformation were the subjects du jour but have since lost media and consumer focus\n\nProjects I worked on included:\n• Product design and strategy\n• Brand identity and messaging\n• Designed and did front-end dev for our search product (using React/NextJS)\n• Pitch deck design and copywriting",

          "description": "Like many Fortune 100 companies at the time, Home Depot wanted to bolster its technology portfolio and establish a team and presence in Silicon Valley. To do this they acquired a leading Bay Area-based home services startup, Redbeacon, and refashioned it into a technology lab called Techshed that was particularly focused on Home Depot's substantial professional contractor customers (then accounting for over 60% of their revenue) under the Home Depot Pro product line.\n\nI joined Techshed shortly after the acquisition as an Interaction Designer focused on designing and prototyping new product offerings for Home Depot's Pro customers across iOS, Android, and web.\n\nSome of the projects I worked on included:\n\n- Designed a two-sided curbside pickup experience (Express Pickup) that was integrated into the Home Depot Pro app as a checkout option, as well as a companion app for the fulfillment side\n- Designed and prototyped the Home Depot Pro home services app that allows contractors to view, manage, fulfill service leads from homeowners\n- Prototyped novel interactions and patterns for the Home Depot Pro website including add to cart animations\n- Re-designed the checkout flow for the Home Depot Pro mobile app (significant increase in conversion)\n- Developed and co-designed the Techshed website",
